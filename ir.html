Infrared Record and Playback with Puck.js
This video shows you how to control Infrared devices using Puck.js.


You'll need a Puck.js and an Infrared Receiver

Note: If you don't have an IR receiver you may be able to find the 'pronto hex' code for your device online. You can then decode it with this library.

Recording
The code used in the video is:

digitalWrite(D2,0);
pinMode(D1,"input_pullup");
var d = [];
setWatch(function(e) {
  d.push(1000*(e.time-e.lastTime));
}, D1, {edge:"both",repeat:true});
You can use the following to output the contents of the d array rounded to 1 decimal place (which is much more readable):

console.log(d.map(a=>a.toFixed(1)).toString())
In fact adding the following code will automatically print the received Infrared code as soon as you have sent it:

var lastLen = 0;
setInterval(function() {
  if (d.length && d.length==lastLen) {
    d.shift(); // remove first element
    console.log(d.map(a=>a.toFixed(1)).toString());
    d=[];
  }
  lastLen = d.length;
},200);
For the particular light bulb used in the video, the codes are as follows:

Playback
All you need to do to play back is to pass an array into Puck.IR. For example if you have a lightbulb like the one I used, simply typing Puck.IR(commands.on) will turn it on.

You can also use Web Bluetooth to send data from a webpage to any Puck - it doesn't have to be pre-programmed as the Web Page can send the code and data at once.
